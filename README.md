	Description:

The purpose of this program is to provide a way of storing passwords in a local setting, though future implementations of sockets might take place for a better way to store the data.
1. Encryption used is AES, key size is 256, will include a choice in the future as well.
2. Uses multiple JFC classes, GUI components are in Swing, Action Listeners are in AWT.
3. The architecture is simple, for now, it has three classes all within a single thread and no inheritence.
4. Though some Data is stored in Data files, Most data is stored in text files, this is for the Developers (me) convenience. In the release, the data will be stored in a better way.
